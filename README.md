### Description of Data
Coursera is the largest massive open online course (MOOC) provider in the world and hosts many courses from top universities in different subjects. There are 1.45 million course reviews posted by students and participants in dataset.
There are two datasets provide:
'Coursera_courses' contains a list of 623 (actually in description it is written as 622 but in dataset it seems 623) courses on Coursera and 
'Coursera_reviews' is a list of 1.45 million reviews along with ratings

### Planning
- Mainly the codes will be as follows :

### Data Cleaning

- Checking null values
- Convert data to proper formats
- Rename columns names

### Get Some Basic Statistics About Data
- Determine the courses the most reviewed
- Determine Average score per course
- Determine the organization the most reviewed
- Determine organizations that provide the most courses İn the given dataset
- Determine Average score per institution
- Examine the reviews rate along with ratings	 

### Sentimental Analysis on Reviews
